Programming Paradigm\n*   **PRO1** focuses on **imperative programming**. You learn how to give the computer a sequence of instructions to solve a problem.\n*   **PRO2** introduces **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. Instead of just functions and variables, you learn to organize code into classes and objects, focusing on encapsulation and modularity.\n\n#### 2. Technical Content\n*   **PRO1 Topics:** Basic syntax, control structures (loops, if-else), functions, recursion, and basic data sequences like vectors.\n*   **PRO2 Topics:** Classes, linear data structures (stacks, queues, lists), non-linear structures (trees), and advanced use of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).\n\n#### 3. Progression\n*   **PRO1** is about learning \"how to code\"—the logic behind algorithms and basic problem-solving.\n*   **PRO2** is about \"how to design software\"—organizing complex code efficiently and choosing the right data structures for the job.\n\n### Prerequisites\n*   **PRO1** has no prerequisites and assumes no prior programming knowledge.\n*   **PRO2** technically requires the knowledge from PRO1. While the system may allow enrollment, it is extremely difficult to pass PRO2 without a solid grasp of PRO1 concepts (especially recursion and pointers).\n\n### Relevant Links\n*   [PRO1 Official Syllabus](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/bachelors-degrees/bachelor-degree-informatics-engineering/curriculum/syllabus/PRO1)\n*   [PRO2 Official Syllabus](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/bachelors-degrees/bachelor-degree-informatics-engineering/curriculum/syllabus/PRO2)",

      "question": "What international study opportunities are available?",
      "final_response": "FIB offers several international study opportunities that are particularly relevant for you as a Master's student (enrolled in MDS/MAI courses). Since it is currently January 7, 2026, the **main application call for the 2026-2027 academic year is approaching in February**.\n\n### 1. Key Mobility Programs\n\n*   **Erasmus+ Studies (Europe):** The most common exchange program. It includes a monthly grant and covers universities across Europe. Popular destinations for Informatics include **KTH** (Sweden), **TU Munich** (Germany), and **TU Delft** (Netherlands).\n*   **Double Degrees:** As a Master's student, you can earn two degrees—one from UPC and one from a partner institution. FIB has strong agreements with:\n    *   **KTH Royal Institute of Technology** (Stockholm, Sweden)\n    *   **IMT** (France)\n    *   **Politecnico di Milano** (Italy)\n*   **UPC-Global (Outside Europe):** Exchanges with universities in the USA, Canada, Asia (like **National University of Singapore**), and Australia. These typically require a higher GPA and earlier preparation.\n*   **Erasmus+ Traineeships:** If you prefer practical experience, you can receive a grant to do an internship or your Master's Thesis (TFM) at a company or research lab in Europe.\n\n### 2. Immediate Opportunities & Deadlines\n\n| Opportunity | Application Period | Target Period |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Main Mobility Call** | **February 2026** | Academic Year 2026-2027 |\n| **Aalto Summer Research** | **Open Now** | Summer 2026 |\n| **Secondary Call** | Sept - Oct 2026 | Spring 2027 |\n\n### 3. Requirements for Master's Students\n*   **Language:** Most destinations require a **B2 level of English** (TOEFL, IELTS, or Cambridge). Some specific countries may require their local language (e.g., French or German).\n*   **Academic Record:** Selection is primarily based on your GPA.\n*   **Learning Agreement:** You will need to ensure the courses you take abroad can be recognized as part of your MDS or MAI curriculum.\n\n### 4. How to Proceed\n1.  **Check the Mobility Portal:** Review the available destinations and specific agreements for your Master's program on the [FIB International Relations (ORI) website](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/international).\n2.  **Attend Information Sessions:** The ORI usually holds briefings in January/February before the main call opens.\n3.  **Apply via e-Secretaria:** When the call opens in February, you will submit your destination preferences through the [e-Secretaria](https://esecretaria.upc.edu/).\n\nIf you have a specific destination or country in mind, I can help you check if there is an active agreement for your study plan.",

BSG-MDS: Bioinformatics and Statistical Genetics\n*   **Difficulty:** High\n*   **Why:** This is often considered one of the more challenging courses due to the heavy emphasis on **statistical theory** and its application to complex biological data. If you don't have a strong background in statistics, the learning curve can be steep.\n*   **Upcoming Exam:** **Final Exam on January 14, 2026 (11:30 - 14:30)** in room A5103.\n\n### 2. DAKD-MDS: Data Analysis and Knowledge Discovery\n*   **Difficulty:** Moderate to High\n*   **Why:** While the concepts are very practical for a data scientist, the workload can be high because it involves advanced data mining techniques and knowledge extraction. It requires a solid grasp of Python/R and data processing workflows.\n*   **Upcoming Exam:** **Final Exam on January 15, 2026 (15:00 - 18:00)** in room A5106.\n\n### 3. HLE-MAI: Human Language Engineering\n*   **Difficulty:** Moderate\n*   **Why:** With 4.5 ECTS, it has a lower formal workload than the others. However, Natural Language Processing (NLP) involves a lot of programming and understanding of linguistic nuances. \n*   **Assessment:** There is **no final exam** listed in the system, which usually means the grade is heavily based on projects and labs.\n\n### Summary\nIf you are asking about the **upcoming week**, yes, it will be \"hard\" because you have two major 3-hour final exams on consecutive days (Jan 14 and 15). \n\n**Are you struggling with a specific topic in one of these, or were you asking about a different course entirely?**",

      "question": "Is APC hard?",
      "final_response": "Whether **APC (PC Architecture)** is \"hard\" depends on your strengths, but it is generally considered a technically focused course with a significant practical workload.\n\nHere is an objective breakdown to help you gauge the difficulty:\n\n### 1. Evaluation Style: Project-Based\nOne of the most important things to note about APC is that it **does not have formal partial or final exams** in the standard FIB exam calendar. \n*   **Meaning:** The course likely follows a **continuous evaluation** model.\n*   **Difficulty Factor:** Instead of studying for one big exam, your grade will depend on **projects and laboratory assignments**. This means a steady workload throughout the semester rather than a single crunch period, which many students find more manageable but time-consuming.\n\n### 2. Technical Focus\nThe course is managed by the **Computer Architecture (AC)** department. At FIB, AC courses are known for being detail-oriented. You will likely deal with:\n*   Processor architectures and performance optimization.\n*   Memory hierarchy (Cache, RAM) and how hardware interacts with software.\n*   System buses and I/O subsystems.\n\n### 3. Course Profile\n*   **Level:** It is a 5th-semester (3rd year) elective for the Bachelor in Informatics (GRAU) and Data Science (GCED).\n*   **Credits:** 6 ECTS (Standard workload of ~150-180 hours).\n*   **Teaching Team:** It is currently taught by a small team (often just **Professor Daniel Naro**), which usually allows for more direct interaction but also means the course follows a very specific vision.\n\n### Summary for your Context\nAs you are currently enrolled in **Master's programs (MDS/MAI)**:\n*   **If you enjoy low-level systems:** You might find the concepts straightforward, but don't underestimate the time required for the lab projects.\n*   **If you prefer high-level data analysis:** The transition to hardware-centric logic and low-level performance metrics might feel like a significant shift in thinking.\n\n**Conclusion:** It is not considered a \"filter\" course (like the notoriously difficult early-degree subjects), but it requires **consistent dedication to the projects** to succeed. \n\nYou can find the full syllabus and more details [here](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/bachelors-degrees/bachelor-degree-informatics-engineering/curriculum/syllabus/APC).",
