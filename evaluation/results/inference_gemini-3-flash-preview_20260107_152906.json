Progression\n*   **PRO1** is about learning \"how to code\"\u2014the logic behind algorithms and basic problem-solving.\n*   **PRO2** is about \"how to design software\"\u2014organizing complex code efficiently and choosing the right data structures for the job.\n\n### Prerequisites\n*   **PRO1** has no prerequisites and assumes no prior programming knowledge.\n*   **PRO2** technically requires the knowledge from PRO1.

Objectives & Focus\n*   **PRO1 (Programming I):** The primary objective is to introduce students to the fundamental concepts of programming and algorithmic thinking. It focuses on the imperative programming paradigm using C++.\n*   **PRO2 (Programming II):** This course builds upon the foundations laid in PRO1. It transitions the student from basic imperative programming to object-oriented programming (OOP) and the initial study of data structures.\n\n#### 2. Content Overview\n*   **PRO1:** \n    *   Basic syntax and program structure.\n    *   Primitive data types and variables.\n    *   Control structures (conditionals and loops).\n    *   Procedures and functions (modular programming).\n    *   Introduction to recursion.\n    *   Basic sequences and vectors.\n*   **PRO2:** \n    *   **Object-Oriented Programming:** Classes, objects, encapsulation, and modularity.\n    *   **Data Structures:** Linear structures (stacks, queues, lists) and non-linear structures (trees).\n    *   **Advanced Recursion:** Working with complex recursive structures.\n    *   **Generic Programming:** Use of templates and standard libraries (STL).\n\n#### 3. Prerequisites\n*   **PRO1:** None (it is an introductory course).\n*   **PRO2:** While not strictly blocked in all enrollment scenarios, it is academically designed to be taken after **PRO1**. Success in PRO2 requires a solid understanding of the logic, recursion, and basic C++ syntax taught in PRO1.\n\n#### 4. Teaching Faculty\nBoth courses are taught by a large team from the Computer Science department. Notable professors teaching both or rotating between them include:\n*   **Jorge Castro Rabal** (jcastro@cs.upc.edu)\n*   **Pau Fernandez Duran** (pau.fernandez@upc.edu)\n*   **Alfonso Valverde Ruiz** (alfons@cs.upc.edu)\n*   **Xavier Ventura Simon** (xavier.ventura.simon@upc.edu)\n\n### Relevant Links\n*   [PRO1 Syllabus](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/bachelors-degrees/bachelor-degree-informatics-engineering/curriculum/syllabus/PRO1)\n*   [PRO2 Syllabus](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/bachelors-degrees/bachelor-degree-informatics-engineering/curriculum/syllabus/PRO2)"

Since it is currently January 7, 2026, the **main application call for the 2026-2027 academic year is approaching in February**.\n\n### 1. Key Mobility Programs\n\n*   **Erasmus+ Studies (Europe):** The most common exchange program. It includes a monthly grant and covers universities across Europe. Popular destinations for Informatics include **KTH** (Sweden), **TU Munich** (Germany), and **TU Delft** (Netherlands).\n*   **Double Degrees:** As a Master's student, you can earn two degrees\u2014one from UPC and one from a partner institution. FIB has strong agreements with:\n    *   **KTH Royal Institute of Technology** (Stockholm, Sweden)\n    *   **IMT** (France)\n    *   **Politecnico di Milano** (Italy)\n*   **UPC-Global (Outside Europe):** Exchanges with universities in the USA, Canada, Asia (like **National University of Singapore**), and Australia. These typically require a higher GPA and earlier preparation.\n*   **Erasmus+ Traineeships:** If you prefer practical experience, you can receive a grant to do an internship or your Master's Thesis (TFM) at a company or research lab in Europe.\n\n### 2. Immediate Opportunities & Deadlines\n\n| Opportunity | Application Period | Target Period |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Main Mobility Call** | **February 2026** | Academic Year 2026-2027 |\n| **Aalto Summer Research** | **Open Now** | Summer 2026 |\n| **Secondary Call** | Sept - Oct 2026 | Spring 2027 |\n\n### 3. Requirements for Master's Students\n*   **Language:** Most destinations require a **B2 level of English** (TOEFL, IELTS, or Cambridge). Some specific countries may require their local language (e.g., French or German).\n*   **Academic Record:** Selection is primarily based on your GPA.\n*   **Learning Agreement:** You will need to ensure the courses you take abroad can be recognized as part of your MDS or MAI curriculum.\n\n### 4. How to Proceed\n1.  **Check the Mobility Portal:** Review the available destinations and specific agreements for your Master's program on the [FIB International Relations (ORI) website](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/international).\n2.  **Attend Information Sessions:** The ORI usually holds briefings in January/February before the main call opens.\n3.  **Apply via e-Secretaria:** When the call opens in February, you will submit your destination preferences through the [e-Secretaria](https://esecretaria.upc.edu/).\n\nIf you have a specific destination or country in mind, I can help you check if there is an active agreement for your study plan.",

Specifically, it is during the final exam period for the autumn term (exams for courses like *LP*, *IES*, and *ALG-GCED* are scheduled on this day).\n- **\"Next Semester\":** Relative to January 2026, the \"next semester\" refers to **2025Q2** (Spring semester of the 2025-2026 academic year), which typically begins in mid-February 2026.\n\n### Identifying User Study Plan\nThere is **no direct way** to identify a user's study plan from their username or profile details using the public FIB data tools, as these tools do not provide access to student records or private profile data. \n\nHowever, you can often identify a program through the following indirect methods:\n1. **Course Codes**: Many course codes include suffixes that indicate the study plan (e.g., `-MAI` for Master in AI, `-GCED` for Data Science, `-GIA` for Artificial Intelligence Degree).\n2. **Course Exclusivity**: If a user is taking a course that is only offered in one study plan (e.g., `AP3-BBI` is exclusive to the Bioinformatics degree), their program can be inferred.\n3. **UPC Username**: Standard FIB/UPC usernames (`firstname.lastname`) do not contain program info. However, if a user is faculty, they can be found using `search_professors`, which lists their department.\n\n### Summary of Academic Terms\n| Term ID | Semester | Academic Year | Status |\n|---------|----------|---------------|--------|\n| **2025Q1** | Autumn (Q1) | 2025-2026 | **Current** (Ends Feb 2026) |\n| **2025Q2** | Spring (Q2) | 2025-2026 | **Next** (Starts Feb 2026) |\n\n*For more details on specific courses or exam dates, you can use `get_course_details(course_code)` or `search_exams(course_code)`.*"

Since today is January 7th, you are likely preparing for the upcoming final exams.\n\nHere is an overview of the difficulty and workload for your current courses:\n\n### 1. BSG-MDS: Bioinformatics and Statistical Genetics\n*   **Difficulty:** High\n*   **Why:** This is often considered one of the more challenging courses due to the heavy emphasis on **statistical theory** and its application to complex biological data. If you don't have a strong background in statistics, the learning curve can be steep.\n*   **Upcoming Exam:** **Final Exam on January 14, 2026 (11:30 - 14:30)** in room A5103.\n\n### 2. DAKD-MDS: Data Analysis and Knowledge Discovery\n*   **Difficulty:** Moderate to High\n*   **Why:** While the concepts are very practical for a data scientist, the workload can be high because it involves advanced data mining techniques and knowledge extraction. It requires a solid grasp of Python/R and data processing workflows.\n*   **Upcoming Exam:** **Final Exam on January 15, 2026 (15:00 - 18:00)** in room A5106.\n\n### 3. HLE-MAI: Human Language Engineering\n*   **Difficulty:** Moderate\n*   **Why:** With 4.5 ECTS, it has a lower formal workload than the others. However, Natural Language Processing (NLP) involves a lot of programming and understanding of linguistic nuances. \n*   **Assessment:** There is **no final exam** listed in the system, which usually means the grade is heavily based on projects and labs.\n\n### Summary\nIf you are asking about the **upcoming week**, yes, it will be \"hard\" because you have two major 3-hour final exams on consecutive days (Jan 14 and 15). \n\n**Are you struggling with a specific topic in one of these, or were you asking about a different course entirely?**",

Since today is January 7th, you are likely preparing for the upcoming final exams.\n\nHere is an overview of the difficulty and workload for your current courses:\n\n### 1. BSG-MDS: Bioinformatics and Statistical Genetics\n*   **Difficulty:** High\n*   **Why:** This is often considered one of the more challenging courses due to the heavy emphasis on **statistical theory** and its application to complex biological data. If you don't have a strong background in statistics, the learning curve can be steep.\n*   **Upcoming Exam:** **Final Exam on January 14, 2026 (11:30 - 14:30)** in room A5103.\n\n### 2. DAKD-MDS: Data Analysis and Knowledge Discovery\n*   **Difficulty:** Moderate to High\n*   **Why:** While the concepts are very practical for a data scientist, the workload can be high because it involves advanced data mining techniques and knowledge extraction. It requires a solid grasp of Python/R and data processing workflows.\n*   **Upcoming Exam:** **Final Exam on January 15, 2026 (15:00 - 18:00)** in room A5106.\n\n### 3. HLE-MAI: Human Language Engineering\n*   **Difficulty:** Moderate\n*   **Why:** With 4.5 ECTS, it has a lower formal workload than the others. However, Natural Language Processing (NLP) involves a lot of programming and understanding of linguistic nuances. \n*   **Assessment:** There is **no final exam** listed in the system, which usually means the grade is heavily based on projects and labs.\n\n### Summary\nIf you are asking about the **upcoming week**, yes, it will be \"hard\" because you have two major 3-hour final exams on consecutive days (Jan 14 and 15). \n\n**Are you struggling with a specific topic in one of these, or were you asking about a different course entirely?**"

FIB-Specific Advantages\nAs a FIB (UPC) student, you have a significant advantage in the local market:\n*   **FIB Visiona:** The faculty\u2019s annual career fair is one of the best ways to meet recruiters from companies like **Bloomberg, NTT Data, Accenture, and HP** directly on campus.\n*   **Internships (Convenis):** FIB has strong ties with local industry, allowing you to gain experience at top companies while finishing your degree, often leading to a full-time offer.\n*   **Reputation:** UPC is consistently ranked as one of the best technical universities in Southern Europe, and a degree from FIB is highly respected by local and international recruiters.\n\n### Tips for Success\n1.  **English is Mandatory:** While Catalan and Spanish are important for social life, almost all high-growth tech companies in Barcelona operate in English.\n2.  **Network at Events:** Attend meetups at places like **Barcelona Activa** or the **Pier01 (Tech Barcelona)** hub.\n3.  **Use FIB Resources:** Keep an eye on the \"Notices\" section of your FIB account for company presentations and job offers specifically for UPC students.",

      "final_response": "For a student at FIB, especially considering your current enrollment in the **Master in Data Science (MDS)** and **Master in Artificial Intelligence (MAI)**, the choice of programming languages is quite clear.\n\n### 1. Python (The Essential)\nPython is the undisputed leader in AI and the primary language for your current courses.\n*   **Relevance to your courses:** In **HLE-MAI** (Human Language Engineering), Python is the standard for NLP (Natural Language Processing) using libraries like Hugging Face, NLTK, or SpaCy. In **DAKD-MDS**, it's the go-to for data processing.\n*   **Why learn it:** It has the most mature ecosystem (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn) and is used for everything from rapid prototyping to deploying large-scale LLMs.\n\n### 2. R (The Statistical Powerhouse)\nAs an MDS student, R is likely a significant part of your curriculum.\n*   **Relevance to your courses:** **BSG-MDS** (Bioinformatics and Statistical Genetics) and **DAKD-MDS** (Data Analysis and Knowledge Discovery) often rely on R for its superior statistical modeling and data visualization capabilities (ggplot2, Bioconductor).\n*   **Why learn it:** It remains the industry standard for academic research and advanced statistical analysis in fields like bioinformatics.\n\n### 3. C++ (The Performance Layer)\nWhile not always used in high-level AI research, C++ is critical for the \"under the hood\" operations.\n*   **Use case:** If you are interested in **Computer Vision**, **Robotics**, or building the actual AI frameworks themselves (like the core of TensorFlow/PyTorch), C++ is essential for performance and memory management.\n*   **At FIB:** It is used in more hardware-oriented or performance-critical courses in the GEI (Bachelor's) or specialized Master's modules.\n\n### 4. Julia (The Rising Star)\nJulia is gaining traction in scientific computing.\n*   **Why learn it:** It aims to combine the speed of C++ with the ease of Python. It is excellent for heavy numerical simulations and optimization problems.\n\n### 5. Prolog (The Logic Foundation)\n*   **At FIB:** If you haven't taken it already, the **IA** (Artificial Intelligence) course in the Bachelor's degree uses Prolog.\n*   **Why learn it:** It is useful for understanding symbolic AI, logic programming, and knowledge representation, which are different from the statistical machine learning dominating the field today.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table for your Profile\n\n| Language | Priority | Usage in Your Program (MDS/MAI) | Recommended Libraries |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Python** | **High** | NLP (HLE), Data Analysis (DAKD), ML | PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Transformers |\n| **R** | **High** | Bioinformatics (BSG), Statistics | Tidyverse, Bioconductor, Caret |\n| **C++** | Medium | High-performance AI, Computer Vision | OpenCV, CUDA |\n| **Julia** | Low | Numerical Optimization | Flux.jl, DifferentialEquations.jl |\n\n**My Recommendation:** Focus heavily on mastering **Python** for your NLP and general AI work, while ensuring you are proficient in **R** for your bioinformatics and statistical analysis. If you want to stand out in the job market for AI engineering roles, learning **C++** for performance optimization is a strong secondary skill.",

          "content": "For a student at FIB, especially considering your current enrollment in the **Master in Data Science (MDS)** and **Master in Artificial Intelligence (MAI)**, the choice of programming languages is quite clear.\n\n### 1. Python (The Essential)\nPython is the undisputed leader in AI and the primary language for your current courses.\n*   **Relevance to your courses:** In **HLE-MAI** (Human Language Engineering), Python is the standard for NLP (Natural Language Processing) using libraries like Hugging Face, NLTK, or SpaCy. In **DAKD-MDS**, it's the go-to for data processing.\n*   **Why learn it:** It has the most mature ecosystem (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn) and is used for everything from rapid prototyping to deploying large-scale LLMs.\n\n### 2. R (The Statistical Powerhouse)\nAs an MDS student, R is likely a significant part of your curriculum.\n*   **Relevance to your courses:** **BSG-MDS** (Bioinformatics and Statistical Genetics) and **DAKD-MDS** (Data Analysis and Knowledge Discovery) often rely on R for its superior statistical modeling and data visualization capabilities (ggplot2, Bioconductor).\n*   **Why learn it:** It remains the industry standard for academic research and advanced statistical analysis in fields like bioinformatics.\n\n### 3. C++ (The Performance Layer)\nWhile not always used in high-level AI research, C++ is critical for the \"under the hood\" operations.\n*   **Use case:** If you are interested in **Computer Vision**, **Robotics**, or building the actual AI frameworks themselves (like the core of TensorFlow/PyTorch), C++ is essential for performance and memory management.\n*   **At FIB:** It is used in more hardware-oriented or performance-critical courses in the GEI (Bachelor's) or specialized Master's modules.\n\n### 4. Julia (The Rising Star)\nJulia is gaining traction in scientific computing.\n*   **Why learn it:** It aims to combine the speed of C++ with the ease of Python. It is excellent for heavy numerical simulations and optimization problems.\n\n### 5. Prolog (The Logic Foundation)\n*   **At FIB:** If you haven't taken it already, the **IA** (Artificial Intelligence) course in the Bachelor's degree uses Prolog.\n*   **Why learn it:** It is useful for understanding symbolic AI, logic programming, and knowledge representation, which are different from the statistical machine learning dominating the field today.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table for your Profile\n\n| Language | Priority | Usage in Your Program (MDS/MAI) | Recommended Libraries |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Python** | **High** | NLP (HLE), Data Analysis (DAKD), ML | PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Transformers |\n| **R** | **High** | Bioinformatics (BSG), Statistics | Tidyverse, Bioconductor, Caret |\n| **C++** | Medium | High-performance AI, Computer Vision | OpenCV, CUDA |\n| **Julia** | Low | Numerical Optimization | Flux.jl, DifferentialEquations.jl |\n\n**My Recommendation:** Focus heavily on mastering **Python** for your NLP and general AI work, while ensuring you are proficient in **R** for your bioinformatics and statistical analysis. If you want to stand out in the job market for AI engineering roles, learning **C++** for performance optimization is a strong secondary skill."
