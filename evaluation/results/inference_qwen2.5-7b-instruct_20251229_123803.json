This indicates that the exam might cover a wide range of topics related to the course.\n\n2. **Exam Instructions**: The document from CourseHero provides a detailed schedule for the exam, including preparation and exam phases. This can help you understand the format and timing of the exam.\n\n3. **Practice Tests**: The Gururo link offers 9 full-length practice tests, which can be very useful for preparing for the final exam. These tests are designed to cover all critical aspects of the Data Structures and Algorithms exam.\n\n4. **General Tips**: The Quora link provides general advice on how to make a study schedule for learning Data Structures and Algorithms in a short period. It suggests using at least 8 hours daily for understanding and implementing data structures.\n\nGiven that there are no specific exam schedules listed, it's best to refer to your course syllabus and any announcements from your professor for the exact exam details.

This indicates that the exam might cover a wide range of topics related to the course.\n\n2. **Exam Instructions**: The document from CourseHero provides a detailed schedule for the exam, including preparation and exam phases. This can help you understand the format and timing of the exam.\n\n3. **Practice Tests**: The Gururo link offers 9 full-length practice tests, which can be very useful for preparing for the final exam. These tests are designed to cover all critical aspects of the Data Structures and Algorithms exam.\n\n4. **General Tips**: The Quora link provides general advice on how to make a study schedule for learning Data Structures and Algorithms in a short period. It suggests using at least 8 hours daily for understanding and implementing data structures.\n\nGiven that there are no specific exam schedules listed, it's best to refer to your course syllabus and any announcements from your professor for the exact exam details. If you have access to the course syllabus or any announcements, please share them so I can provide more specific information.\n\nWould you like to proceed with this information, or do you need help with anything else?"

However, there are some important updates and assignments related to the course:\n\n1. **Laboratory Assignment**: Due before Sunday, 21st December (included).\n2. **Rescheduling of the Course Calendar**: The course calendar has been modified to include earlier paper presentations.\n3. **Examples of Project Report + Presentation**: These are provided as inspiration for your project.\n4. **Google Sheet for Topic Selection**: A Google Sheet has been shared for selecting topics for your presentation and project.\n\nFor the exam, it is common for exams to be scheduled towards the end of the semester. Since the course calendar has been rescheduled, it is likely that the exam will be held after the last paper presentation. Typically, exams for this course might be scheduled in late November or early December.\n\nIf you have more specific questions or need further details, please let me know!"
